# hmm [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mkevac/hmm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mkevac/hmm)
hmm is a tool for instant charting your data

# Why?

Imagine you have a script that gives you some numbers. Benchmark script that gives you an amount of requests per seconds, for example. It would be great to see these numbers on a chart! hmm can help you with this. You can send an output for your script to hmm's stdin and hmm will open your browser and show these numbers to you as a beautiful atimatically updating chart.

# Example

Suppose you want to observe load average numbers for your operating system. You can print them with a small bash command:

```
echo "Time 1min 5min 15min"; while true; do echo -n $(date +%H:%M:%S); echo -n " "; uptime | cut -d " " -f 9-11; sleep 1; done;
Time 1min 5min 15min
19:32:33 2.38 2.12 2.04
19:32:34 2.38 2.12 2.04
19:32:35 2.40 2.12 2.04
19:32:36 2.38 2.12 2.04
19:32:37 4.01 2.13 2.04
^C
```

Cool. We can use hmm to see this numbers as a chart by sending same data to hmm's stdin:

```
(echo "Time 1min 5min 15min"; while true; do echo -n $(date +%H:%M:%S); echo -n " "; uptime | cut -d " " -f 9-11; sleep 1; done;) | hmm
```

It will look like this:

You can event get data from remote server with ssh:

```
ssh server '(echo "Time 1min 5min 15min"; while true; do echo -n $(date +%H:%M:%S); echo -n " "; uptime | cut -d " " -f 9-11; sleep 1; done;)' | hmm
```

*P.S. These commands work on MacOS. For Linux use*
```
echo "Time 1min 5min 15min"; while true; do echo -n $(date +%H:%M:%S); echo -n " "; cat /proc/loadavg | cut -d " " -f 1-3; sleep 1; done;
```
and
```
(echo "Time 1min 5min 15min"; while true; do echo -n $(date +%H:%M:%S); echo -n " "; cat /proc/loadavg | cut -d " " -f 1-3; sleep 1; done;) | hmm
```
and
```
ssh server '(echo "Time 1min 5min 15min"; while true; do echo -n $(date +%H:%M:%S); echo -n " "; cat /proc/loadavg | cut -d " " -f 1-3; sleep 1; done;)' | hmm
```

# Installation

You can find binaries [here](https://github.com/mkevac/hmm/releases).

Or, similar to most of the go packages, just use go get:

```
go get -u githib.com/mkevac/hmm
```

# Usage

```
$ hmm -h
Usage:
  hmm [OPTIONS]

Application Options:
      --http=     Address on which to listen to (default: localhost:0)
  -n, --noheader  Do not expect header in the first line
  -v, --verbose   Increase verbosity
  -l, --last=     Which period to show (default: 24h)

Help Options:
  -h, --help      Show this help message
```

# Data format

hmm espects that in each input line it gets first column will be value for x axis (usually time or datetime) and all other columns will have values for y axis. One for each line. E.g.
```
10:11:12 10 15 34.2
10:11:13 11 11 36.2
```

First line of input is special. It is called header and it's used to name lines. E.g.
```
Time Line1 Line2 BestLine
```

If you don't have such first line, use -n option.
